Goal: Create an HTML5 file upload script that:

>Requirements:
‘Use SASS and compile into minified CSS file’

>Suggestions:
‘Style however you see fit, more points for the cooler it looks :)’

>Step 1:
‘Allows user to Drag & Drop a file to upload it’
‘Allows users to upload a file via an upload button’
‘Lets users upload the file as not cropped (will distort image to fit container size 200x200px)’
‘Lets users upload the file as cropped (200x200px)’
‘Does not store the file on the server’
‘Display a 200x200px preview of the uploaded image’
‘Has a save button that downloads the image after import’

>Step 2:
‘Create an ‘accessory’ section, of funny hats, glasses, and so on’
‘The accessory section should be thumbnails no larger then 100x100px’
‘When you click a thumbnail it will append to the same div that the image preview is in’
‘You will be able to drag, resize, and rotate the accessory’
‘There should be a defined cropping zone around the uploaded image that keeps the accessories within it’
‘You can add as many fun accessories you would like to an image that you have uploaded’
‘When you click Save the image will download with the accessories imposed over it’

>Step 3: (optional)
‘Disregard the not saving the image on the server requirement and create an area/gallery that shows all of the previous users wacky profile pictures that were created’
